# ValuEnable QA Automation Assignment

## Task 1: Manual Testing

The project includes manual testing artifacts and supporting documents inside the `test-data` folder.

### Included Files
- `JobListings.xlsx` → Contains all identified job listings and additional details.
- `TestCases.xlsx` → Contains executed manual test cases with Pass/Fail status.

### Scope Covered
The manual testing assignment covers:
- Careers page validation
- Job listing verification
- Apply link verification
- Responsive testing (tablet/mobile view)
- UI and usability validation

### Observations Identified
- The provided `career.html` URL returned a 404 page.
- The working careers page was available under `/careers`.
- Apply links redirected to a Google Form with restricted access.
- Tablet view showed text alignment and layout issues.

Task 2: Test Automation

A scalable and maintainable Java-based Test Automation Framework developed for the ValuEnable QA Assignment using Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Maven following the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

The framework automates the following workflow:

Open “Get in Touch” form
Submit the form successfully
Validate error handling for invalid email input

The project is designed using reusable components and automation best practices.

🚀 Project Overview

This framework includes:

Selenium WebDriver automation
TestNG execution
